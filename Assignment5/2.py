'''
From the heatmap, R&D Spend shows a strong correlation with profit (0.97) and Marketing Spend shows a moderate correlation with profit (0.75). However, Administration shows almost no correlation (0.20). Therefore, for our model, I will select two features (R&D Spend, and Marketing Spend) as independent variables and Profit as the target variable.
